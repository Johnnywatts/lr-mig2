  - [x] Create database configuration template

- [x] Database Connection Module
  - [x] Implement PostgreSQL connection handling
  - [x] Add connection pooling with context managers
  - [x] Create basic database operations
  - [x] Add connection testing functionality

- [x] Testing Infrastructure
  - [x] Set up pytest framework
  - [x] Implement basic database connection tests
  - [x] Create logging system for tests
  - [x] Add test result tracking in logs

- [x] Docker Environment
  - [x] Create Dockerfile for application
  - [x] Set up docker-compose.yml for multi-container setup
  - [x] Configure PostgreSQL container
  - [x] Implement container health checks
  - [x] Fix permissions for logging

- [x] File Scanning Module
  - [x] Implement basic scanning functionality
  - [x] Store file and directory information in database
  - [x] Extract and store metadata from image files using PyExifTool
  - [x] Handle external drives and WSL2 path mappings
  - [ ] Add file comparison logic
  - [ ] Handle special cases (export directories, etc.)

- [ ] Category Assignment System
  - [ ] Create spreadsheet export for directory review
  - [ ] Implement category import functionality
  - [ ] Add validation for category assignments
  - [ ] Update database with category information

## Phase 2: Analysis

  - [ ] Implement exact duplicate detection
  - [ ] Implement partial duplicate detection (plus/minus)
  - [ ] Create duplicate reporting functionality

- [ ] Directory Comparison
  - [ ] Compare directory structures
  - [ ] Identify misallocated directories
  - [ ] Generate directory comparison reports

## Phase 3: Management

- [ ] File Operations
  - [ ] Implement safe file movement
  - [ ] Add directory restructuring capabilities
  - [ ] Create audit logging for file operations

- [ ] Cleanup Functionality
  - [ ] Implement safe deletion procedures
  - [ ] Add backup to slow storage options
  - [ ] Create recovery verification tools

## Technical Decisions
- [x] Using PostgreSQL for data storage
- [x] Implementing connection pooling for better performance
- [x] Keeping all logs in version control for historical tracking
- [x] Using Docker for consistent development and deployment environment

## Current Challenges
- [x] Ensuring proper file permissions in Docker environment
- [x] Managing database connections in containerized environment
- [x] Handling Windows paths in WSL2 environment

## Next Phase Goals
1. Run scanner against real libraries to analyze data patterns
2. Implement file comparison logic between libraries
3. Create directory comparison system
4. Begin work on category assignment
