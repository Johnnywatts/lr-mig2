# Development Progress

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

### Completed
1. Project Structure Setup
   - Created basic directory structure (src/, tests/, docker/, sql/)
   - Set up requirements.txt with initial dependencies
   - Created database configuration template

2. Database Connection Module
   - Implemented PostgreSQL connection handling
   - Added connection pooling with context managers
   - Created basic database operations
   - Added connection testing functionality

3. Testing Infrastructure
   - Set up pytest framework
   - Implemented basic database connection tests
   - Created logging system for tests
   - Added test result tracking in logs

4. Docker Environment
   - Created Dockerfile for application
   - Set up docker-compose.yml for multi-container setup
   - Configured PostgreSQL container
   - Implemented container health checks
   - Fixed permissions for logging

### In Progress
1. File Scanning Module
   - Planning metadata extraction
   - Designing file comparison logic

### Next Steps
1. Implement file scanning functionality
2. Add metadata extraction for different file formats
3. Create directory comparison logic
4. Implement category assignment system

## Technical Decisions
1. Using PostgreSQL for data storage
2. Implementing connection pooling for better performance
3. Keeping all logs in version control for historical tracking
4. Using Docker for consistent development and deployment environment

## Current Challenges
1. Ensuring proper file permissions in Docker environment
2. Managing database connections in containerized environment

## Next Phase Goals
1. Complete file scanning implementation
2. Implement metadata extraction
3. Create directory comparison system
4. Begin work on category assignment
